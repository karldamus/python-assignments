# Assignment 2
- - - -
Before a game designer sits down to make a game, they always think - “But how can I make the **most** money from my users, with the least amount of effort?” In this assignment, we won’t try to make the game, but instead we’ll make the part of the game that _really_ makes all the money - Loot boxes! 

We are going to make a text-based store to purchase loot boxes. There will be three tiers of loot boxes: Common, Rare, and Epic. Each loot box will drop 3 items with different probabilities, depending on the type of box. At the end, you will open the boxes and see what you get!
