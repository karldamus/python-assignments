### Job Posting: Raven Ghost Hunting Society
**Job Title:** Paranormal Instrument Software Designer
**Duties:** Developing the software for ghost hunting equipment
**Requirements:** Experience with lists, strings, reading and writing files, and functions 
**Description:** We’re the Raven Ghost Hunting Society (RGHS) and we’re looking for someone to help automate our sensor readings. We go to abandoned houses and take sensor data wth various machines to try and detect ghosts! Our sensors output their data to files, and each sensor uses a slightly different file format. 
We need you to write a program that can read sensor data from our three different sensors, process that data, and output whether or not it’s _abnormal_. If a room has abnormal readings in more than one sensor, we’re dealing with some kind of entity! 
Once you’ve written the software to analyze the sensor data, please generate a report to specify which types of entities are in different rooms. We’ll provide you with some sample data to test against, but beware: the real data might have situations we didn’t account for in the test data sent to you! You might wish to **modify the test data** to account for different situations.
